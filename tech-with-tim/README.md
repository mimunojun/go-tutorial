## Tuto #18 "Mutable & Immutable Data Types"
* There's mutable (changable from other variables) and immutable (not changable)
* Mutables are like:
    * Slice
    * Map
    * etc.
* Immutables are like:
    * int, uint, string, ...
    * *Array*
    * etc.
* Keep in mind that Array is immutable and Slice is mutable, though there's only slight difference between two.
